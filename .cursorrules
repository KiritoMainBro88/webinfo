Writing code is like giving a speech. If you use too many big words, you confuse your audience. Define every word, and you end up putting your audience to sleep. Similarly, when you write code, you shouldn't just focus on making it work. You should also aim to make it readable, understandable, and maintainable for future readers. To paraphrase software engineer Martin Fowler, "Anybody can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

As software developers, understanding how to write clean code that is functional, easy to read, and adheres to best practices helps you create better software consistently.

This article discusses what clean code is and why it's essential and provides principles and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

What Is Clean Code?

Clean code is a term used to refer to code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It was made popular by Robert Cecil Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, who wrote "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" in 2008. In this book, he presented a set of principles and best practices for writing clean code, such as using meaningful names, short functions, clear comments, and consistent formatting.

Ultimately, the goal of clean code is to create software that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and efficient throughout its lifecycle.

Why Is Clean Code Important?

When teams adhere to clean code principles, the code base is easier to read and navigate, which makes it faster for developers to get up to speed and start contributing. Here are some reasons why clean code is essential.

Readability and maintenance: Clean code prioritizes clarity, which makes reading, understanding, and modifying code easier. Writing readable code reduces the time required to grasp the code's functionality, leading to faster development times.

Team collaboration: Clear and consistent code facilitates communication and cooperation among team members. By adhering to established coding standards and writing readable code, developers easily understand each other's work and collaborate more effectively.

Debugging and issue resolution: Clean code is designed with clarity and simplicity, making it easier to locate and understand specific sections of the codebase. Clear structure, meaningful variable names, and well-defined functions make it easier to identify and resolve issues.

Improved quality and reliability: Clean code prioritizes following established coding standards and writing well-structured code. This reduces the risk of introducing errors, leading to higher-quality and more reliable software down the line.

Now that we understand why clean code is essential, let's delve into some best practices and principles to help you write clean code.

Principles of Clean Code

Like a beautiful painting needs the right foundation and brushstrokes, well-crafted code requires adherence to specific principles. These principles help developers write code that is clear, concise, and, ultimately, a joy to work with.

Let's dive in.

1. Avoid Hard-Coded Numbers

Use named constants instead of hard-coded values. Write constants with meaningful names that convey their purpose. This improves clarity and makes it easier to modify the code.

Example:

The example below uses the hard-coded number 0.1 to represent a 10% discount. This makes it difficult to understand the meaning of the number (without a comment) and adjust the discount rate if needed in other parts of the function.

Before:

def calculate_discount(price):  
  discount = price * 0.1 # 10% discount  
  return price - discount

The improved code replaces the hard-coded number with a named constant TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT. The name instantly conveys the meaning of the value, making the code more self-documenting.

After:

def calculate_discount(price):  
  TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1  
  discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT  
  return price - discount

Also, If the discount rate needs to be changed, it only requires modifying the constant declaration, not searching for multiple instances of the hard-coded number.

2. Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names

Choose names for variables, functions, and classes that reflect their purpose and behavior. This makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand without extensive comments. As Robert Martin puts it, “A name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.”

Example:

If we take the code from the previous example, it uses generic names like "price" and "discount," which leaves their purpose ambiguous. Names like "price" and "discount" could be interpreted differently without context.

Before:

def calculate_discount(price):  
  TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1  
  discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT  
  return price - discount

Instead, you can declare the variables to be more descriptive.

After:

def calculate_discount(product_price):  
  TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1  
  discount_amount = product_price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT  
  return product_price - discount_amount

This improved code uses specific names like "product_price" and "discount_amount," providing a clearer understanding of what the variables represent and how we use them.

3. Use Comments Sparingly, and When You Do, Make Them Meaningful

You don't need to comment on obvious things. Excessive or unclear comments can clutter the codebase and become outdated, leading to confusion and a messy codebase.

Example:

Before:

def group_users_by_id(user_id):  
  # This function groups users by id  
  # ... complex logic ...  
  # ... more code …

The comment about the function is redundant and adds no value. The function name already states that it groups users by id; there's no need for a comment stating the same.

Instead, use comments to convey the "why" behind specific actions or explain behaviors.

After:

def group_users_by_id(user_id):  
  """Groups users by id to a specific category (1-9).  
  Warning: Certain characters might not be handled correctly.  
  Please refer to the documentation for supported formats.  
  Args:    
    user_id (str): The user id to be grouped.  
  Returns:    
    int: The category number (1-9) corresponding to the user id.  
  Raises:    
    ValueError: If the user id is invalid or unsupported.  
  """  
  # ... complex logic ...  
  # ... more code …

This comment provides meaningful information about the function's behavior and explains unusual behavior and potential pitfalls.

4. Write Short Functions That Only Do One Thing

Follow the single responsibility principle (SRP), which means that a function should have one purpose and perform it effectively. Functions are more understandable, readable, and maintainable if they only have one job. It also makes testing them very easy. If a function becomes too long or complex, consider breaking it into smaller, more manageable functions.

Example:

Before:

def process_data(data):  
  # ... validate users...  
  # ... calculate values ...  
  # ... format output …

This function performs three tasks: validating users, calculating values, and formatting output. If any of these steps fail, the entire function fails, making debugging a complex issue. If we also need to change the logic of one of the tasks, we risk introducing unintended side effects in another task.

Instead, try to assign each task a function that does just one thing.

After:

def validate_user(data):  
  # ... data validation logic ...

def calculate_values(data):  
  # ... calculation logic based on validated data ...

def format_output(data):  
  # ... format results for display …

The improved code separates the tasks into distinct functions. This results in more readable, maintainable, and testable code. Also, If a change needs to be made, it will be easier to identify and modify the specific function responsible for the desired functionality.

5. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or Logic

Avoid writing the same code more than once. Instead, reuse your code using functions, classes, modules, libraries, or other abstractions. This makes your code more efficient, consistent, and maintainable. It also reduces the risk of errors and bugs as you only need to modify your code in one place if you need to change or update it.

Example:

Before:

def calculate_book_price(quantity, price):  
  return quantity * price

def calculate_laptop_price(quantity, price):  
  return quantity * price

In the above example, both functions calculate the total price using the same formula. This violates the DRY principle.

We can fix this by defining a single calculate_product_price function that we use for books and laptops. This reduces code duplication and helps improve the maintenance of the codebase.

After:

def calculate_product_price(product_quantity, product_price):  
  return product_quantity * product_price

6. Follow Established Code-Writing Standards

Know your programming language's conventions in terms of spacing, comments, and naming. Most programming languages have community-accepted coding standards and style guides, for example, PEP 8 for Python and Google JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript.

Here are some specific examples:

Java:
Use camelCase for variable, function, and class names.
Indent code with four spaces.
Put opening braces on the same line.

Python:
Use snake_case for variable, function, and class names.
Use spaces over tabs for indentation.
Put opening braces on the same line as the function or class declaration.

JavaScript:
Use camelCase for variable and function names.
Use snake_case for object properties.
Indent code with two spaces.
Put opening braces on the same line as the function or class declaration.

Also, consider extending some of these standards by creating internal coding rules for your organization. This can contain information on creating and naming folders or describing function names within your organization.

7. Encapsulate Nested Conditionals into Functions

One way to improve the readability and clarity of functions is to encapsulate nested if/else statements into other functions. Encapsulating such logic into a function with a descriptive name clarifies its purpose and simplifies code comprehension. In some cases, it also makes it easier to reuse, modify, and test the logic without affecting the rest of the function.

In the code sample below, the discount logic is nested within the calculate_product_discount function, making it difficult to understand at a glance.

Example:

Before:

def calculate_product_discount(product_price):  
  discount_amount = 0  
  if product_price > 100:  
    discount_amount = product_price * 0.1  
  elif price > 50:  
    discount_amount = product_price * 0.05  
  else:  
    discount_amount = 0  
  final_product_price = product_price - discount_amount  
  return final_product_price

We can clean this code up by separating the nested if/else condition that calculates discount logic into another function called get_discount_rate and then calling the get_discount_rate in the calculate_product_discount function. This makes it easier to read at a glance. The get_discount_rate is now isolated and can be reused by other functions in the codebase. It’s also easier to change, test, and debug it without affecting the calculate_discount function.

After:

def calculate_discount(product_price):  
  discount_rate = get_discount_rate(product_price)  
  discount_amount = product_price * discount_rate  
  final_product_price = product_price - discount_amount  
  return final_product_price

def get_discount_rate(product_price):  
  if product_price > 100:  
    return 0.1  
  elif product_price > 50:  
    return 0.05  
  else:  
    return 0

8. Refactor Continuously

Regularly review and refactor your code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability. Consider the readability of your code for the next person who will work on it, and always leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.

9. Use Version Control

Version control systems meticulously track every change made to your codebase, enabling you to understand the evolution of your code and revert to previous versions if needed. This creates a safety net for code refactoring and prevents accidental deletions or overwrites. Use version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to track changes to your codebase and collaborate effectively with others.


Use the Conventional Commit Messages specification to generate commit messages

The commit message should be structured as follows:


```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
``` 
--------------------------------

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

  - fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
  - feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
  - types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
  - footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
  - Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.



### Specification Details

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
A footer’s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
A footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.

Handling Uncertainty and Limitations:

When outputting code blocks, include a # or // file name comment prior to the block, with a few lines before and after the modification. This helps the user identify where to make changes.

Stick to the current architecture choices located in pyproject.toml unless the user suggests a new method or module.

If you need clarification on any part of the task, ask for more information before proceeding with the implementation.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

Svelte Runes

- `$state`: Declare reactive state
  ```typescript
  let count = $state(0);
  ```
- `$derived`: Compute derived values
  ```typescript
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
  ```
- `$effect`: Manage side effects and lifecycle
  ```typescript
  $effect(() => {
    console.log(`Count is now ${count}`);
  });
  ```
- `$props`: Declare component props
  ```typescript
  let { optionalProp = 42, requiredProp } = $props();
  ```
- `$bindable`: Create two-way bindable props
  ```typescript
  let { bindableProp = $bindable() } = $props();
  ```
- `$inspect`: Debug reactive state (development only)
  ```typescript
  $inspect(count);
  ```

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach.
- Leverage Shadcn components for pre-built, customizable UI elements.
- Import Shadcn components from `$lib/components/ui`.
- Organize Tailwind classes using the `cn()` utility from `$lib/utils`.
- Use Svelte's built-in transition and animation features.

Shadcn Color Conventions

- Use `background` and `foreground` convention for colors.
- Define CSS variables without color space function:
  ```css
  --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  ```
- Usage example:
  ```svelte

SvelteKit Project Structure

- Use the recommended SvelteKit project structure:
  ```
  - src/
    - lib/
    - routes/
    - app.html
    - static/
    - svelte.config.js
    - vite.config.js
  ```

Component Development

- Create .svelte files for Svelte components.
- Use .svelte.ts files for component logic and state machines.
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use Svelte's props for data passing.
- Leverage Svelte's reactive declarations for local state management.

State Management

- Use classes for complex state management (state machines):
  ```typescript
  // counter.svelte.ts
  class Counter {
    count = $state(0);
    incrementor = $state(1);
    increment() {
      this.count += this.incrementor;
    }
    resetCount() {
      this.count = 0;
    }
    resetIncrementor() {
      this.incrementor = 1;
    }
  }
  export const counter = new Counter();
  ```
- Use in components:
  ```svelte
  <br />
  import { counter } from './counter.svelte.ts';
  <br />
  <button on:click={() => counter.increment()}>
    Count: {counter.count}
  ```

Routing and Pages

- Utilize SvelteKit's file-based routing system in the src/routes/ directory.
- Implement dynamic routes using [slug] syntax.
- Use load functions for server-side data fetching and pre-rendering.
- Implement proper error handling with +error.svelte pages.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)

- Leverage SvelteKit's SSR capabilities for dynamic content.
- Implement SSG for static pages using prerender option.
- Use the adapter-auto for automatic deployment configuration.

Performance Optimization

- Leverage Svelte's compile-time optimizations.
- Use `{#key}` blocks to force re-rendering of components when needed.
- Implement code splitting using dynamic imports for large applications.
- Profile and monitor performance using browser developer tools.
- Use `$effect.tracking()` to optimize effect dependencies.
- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage SvelteKit's SSR and SSG.
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.

Data Fetching and API Routes

- Use load functions for server-side data fetching.
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.
- Create API routes in the src/routes/api/ directory.
- Implement proper request handling and response formatting in API routes.
- Use SvelteKit's hooks for global API middleware.

SEO and Meta Tags

- Use Svelte:head component for adding meta information.
- Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
- Create reusable SEO components for consistent meta tag management.

Forms and Actions

- Utilize SvelteKit's form actions for server-side form handling.
- Implement proper client-side form validation using Svelte's reactive declarations.
- Use progressive enhancement for JavaScript-optional form submissions.

Internationalization (i18n) with Paraglide.js

- Use Paraglide.js for internationalization: https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs
- Install Paraglide.js: `npm install @inlang/paraglide-js`
- Set up language files in the `languages` directory.
- Use the `t` function to translate strings:
  ```svelte
  <br />
  import { t } from '@inlang/paraglide-js';
  <br />
  - Support multiple languages and RTL layouts.
  - Ensure text scaling and font adjustments for accessibility.

Accessibility

- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Svelte components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.
- Use Svelte's bind:this for managing focus programmatically.

Key Conventions

1. Embrace Svelte's simplicity and avoid over-engineering solutions.
2. Use SvelteKit for full-stack applications with SSR and API routes.
3. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for performance optimization.
4. Use environment variables for configuration management.
5. Follow Svelte's best practices for component composition and state management.
6. Ensure cross-browser compatibility by testing on multiple platforms.
7. Keep your Svelte and SvelteKit versions up to date.

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
Avoid enums; use maps instead.
Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
Limit 'use client': Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
